      <description>&lt;p&gt;For some time I wanted to dab into functional programming and see how different
it is from the procedural approach. Since three of my colleagues at
&lt;a href=&#34;https://tradeo.com/&#34;&gt;Tradeo.com&lt;/a&gt; are Clojure masters (one of them wrote the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/bbatsov/clojure-style-guide&#34;&gt;Clojure Style Guide&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider&#34;&gt;CIDER&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile&#34;&gt;Projectile&lt;/a&gt;, and the other teaches
Clojure to CS students), it looked like the obvious choice. Although there are
other functional languages worth exploring, I realized that there is something
special about Clojure, that made me commit to studying it in depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because you learn a new programming language through your fingers, I decided to
solve as many problems as I can from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.4clojure.com/&#34;&gt;4Clojure&lt;/a&gt;.
So &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jrusev/fourclojure-solutions&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is my repo with the
solutions. What&amp;rsquo;s great about the site is that after you solve a problem, you
can see how other people have solved it. I have subscribed to some of the top
users, and it is a great way to learn how to write idiomatic Clojure.&lt;/p&gt;
