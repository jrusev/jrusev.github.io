For some time I wanted to dab into functional programming and see how different
it is from the procedural approach. Since three of my colleagues at
[Tradeo.com](https://tradeo.com/) are Clojure masters (one of them wrote the
[Clojure Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/clojure-style-guide),
[CIDER](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider) and
[Projectile](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile), and the other teaches
Clojure to CS students), it looked like the obvious choice. Although there are
other functional languages worth exploring, I realized that there is something
special about Clojure, that made me commit to studying it in depth.

Because you learn a new programming language through your fingers, I decided to
solve as many problems as I can from [4Clojure](http://www.4clojure.com/).
So [here](https://github.com/jrusev/fourclojure-solutions) is my repo with the
solutions. What's great about the site is that after you solve a problem, you
can see how other people have solved it. I have subscribed to some of the top
users, and it is a great way to learn how to write idiomatic Clojure.
