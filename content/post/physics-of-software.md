This is something I read recently, that I think sums up rather nicely what
programming is:

>
“The physics of software is not algorithms, data structures, languages and
abstractions. These are just tools we make, use, throw away. The real physics of
software is the physics of people — specifically, our limitations when it comes
to complexity, and our desire to work together to solve large problems in pieces.
This is the science of programming: make building blocks that people can
understand and use easily, and people will work together to solve the very
largest problems.”
