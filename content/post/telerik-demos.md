Here are some of the applications I worked on while studying at the
[Telerik Software Academy](http://academy.telerik.com/):

* [LetterpressJS](http://jrusev.github.io/demos/LetterpressJS)
* [Tic-Tac-Toe](http://jrusev.github.io/demos/Tic-Tac-Toe)
* [itemex.herokuapp.com](http://itemex.herokuapp.com/) / [adList.apphb.com](http://adlist.apphb.com/)
* [SimplyChat for iOS](https://github.com/jrusev/SimplyChat-iOS)

LetterpressJS is a javascript implementation of the word game Letterpress by
[atebits](http://www.atebits.com/letterpress/). The web app brings the fluid
experience of the iOS game to the browser. Pick letters to form a word and drag
the tiles around to see how they interact with other tiles.

Tic-Tac-Toe is single-page web application that allows you to play online against
other players. The client is powered by AngularJS, and uses a REST service with
ASP.NET Web API hosted on AppHarbor.

ItemEx is an online marketplace for used items. It allows users to create a
profile, post ads, view other people's ads, send messages and receive push
notifications. Admins can manage users and ads. The application is built on the
MEAN stack - MongoDB, Express, AngularJS and Node.js. I also developed the same
application using ASP.NET MVC and SQL Server
([adList.apphb.com](http://adlist.apphb.com/)).

SimplyChat is a real-time chat application for iOS. It's a native app written in
Objective-C. I wrote the backend as a REST service running on Node.js and
MongoDB. For the moment the app has only the basic functionality, but I will
develop it into a more polished app with features such as group chat, photo
messages, etc.
